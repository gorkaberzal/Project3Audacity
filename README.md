===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game. 3. to load the game locally(download/clone the repository).

1.Press the up, left, up, down and right keys on your keyboard to move the champion across the board game. the objective is to reach the water at the very top of the board without been cached by any of the enemies or bugs.

2.The game shows the champion at the begining at the very bottom of the game centered. If you are collided by a bug then the game restarts and puts you in your initial position. On the other hand when you reach the water then you see the words "Game Over", followed by the bottom replay. 

3. The game to be cloned from Github https://github.com/gorkaberzal/Project3Audacity.git. It will download all the files required to play the game. Then you have to open in a browser the index.html file and that is... ready to paly!!!
